## Hi! I'm Ashley!👋🏼

🧠 About Me 

I’m a senior at **Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE)** majoring in **Mass Communications** with a focus in **Journalism**, and I’m also pursuing a **Creative Writing minor**. When I’m not in class, you’ll find me managing a **T-Mobile store in St. Charles, Missouri** where I spend most of my time helping customers remember the passwords they set up. I have a strong passion for **music journalism**, combining my love for writing with my interest in the music industry.
